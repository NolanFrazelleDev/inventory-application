This is an application centered around inventory, with a baises toward large-scale industrial applications

Make a basic inventory app with several frameworks, like one for a shelter, one for corn, and another for manufactured wooden planks. The base of the application will still be module based. Upload a picture, if they want. The ability to name the inventory. 

Key things for the app:
-Upload a picture
-Ability to name inventory
-Ability to have more than one inventory (here is where monetization happens. The first 10 inventories are free otherwise it is $7.50 a month.)

Key things for each individual inventory: 
- Ability to place 'tiles' to represent item to be inventoried
- Each tile will display what it represents
